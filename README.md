# Positive-Displacement-Flowmeter-
Design, engineer and build an Oval Gear (positive displacement) Flowmeter using Arduino

simple, robust oval gear flow meter means it is stable in harsh environments and maintains accuracy regardless of the liquid temperature, changes in viscosity, or pulsating flow. Program it to calculate volume of the water, how much water has flown by measuring different parameters like density and many other different parameters. We are going to use reed switch and hall sensors with Arduino. According to that we will do the Arduino based coding.

aim of the project is to measure the flow rate of the water and many other liquids of different density and other different parameters. We will test both sensors (Hall and Reed switch) to check which gives more efficiency.

A flowmeter is a device that measures the flow of fluid passing through the line in an industrial setup. It is used in an array on industries with applications related to natural gas, steam flow, gas blending and mixing, boiler efficiency, compressed air and so on.
